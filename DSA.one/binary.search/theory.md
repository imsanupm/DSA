## what is binary search


*Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find an element within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the middle element of the array with the target value, and eliminating the half in which the target cannot lie. This process continues until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.*
